An Analysis of Pakistani Homes

In this notebook I create different machine learning models
to predict home prices in Pakistan. We use Linear Regression Methods, 
K-Nearest Neighbors Methods, and Decision Tree Methods.
We look at many different predictors such as: area, location, number of bathrooms,
number of bedrooms, and other predictors. Dataset can be found on Kaggle at:
