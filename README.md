An Analysis of Pakistani Homes

In this notebook I create different machine learning models
to predict home prices in Pakistan. We look at many differnt
predictors such as: area, location, number of bathrooms,
number of bedrooms, and other predictors. We use 
Linear Regression Methods, K-Nearest Neighbors Methods, and 
Decision Tree Methods. Dataset can be found on Kaggle at:
